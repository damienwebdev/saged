Changelog v1.1.0

2/9/2014

Addition of new Calculation Pages:
/powerModRing.html
/primalityTester.html
/QuadraticResidue.html

Notes:
First attempts at large number calculations for primality testing using 500 digits primes ends 
with a 50 second long CORRECT calculation

TODO:

User input for each page must be made, I predict it won't be hard. Implementation with sage may be odd.
